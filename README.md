# Project Details

The NYC taxi trip duration dataset is a dataset released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes several features like pickup time, 
dropoff time, pickup coordinates etc as possible predictors for prediction of taxi trip duration. 
The aim of this project is to accurately predict the trip duration using a regression model, 
using (but not limited to) the above features. This project also focuses on selecting the best combination of input features for accurate prediction, 
by combining both logical reasoning and iterations.




# Conclusion

Here is the Conlusion of the "NEWYORK CITY TRIP DURATION PREDICTION Project", After creating the Linear Regression,Decision Tree,
Random Forest,Gradient Boosting models the best fit model is "RANDOM FOREST".
